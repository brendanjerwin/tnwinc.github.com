At the Dev Labs, our teams are made up of about 4 developers, 2 QA members, and a Product Owner. The team construction varies a bit as circumstances dictate, but it's basically that.

The seating arrangements of agile development teams should encourage communication of all the right kinds. For instance, if your development often requires collaboration between front-end and back-end developers, have them face each other or sit next to each other.

Adjusting requirements is a powerful problem-solving technique; and one which we use often. As a result, some requirements are apt to change quite a bit while developing a feature. 

We found that our QA folks were not always catching our adjustments to requirements before being given a feature to test. As you can imagine, that caused problems.

Simply moving our Product Owner from the far side of the room to a seat next to the QA team members addresses this problem. Now when we discuss our requirements adjustments our QA team members can simply keep an ear out for changes that will interest them.
