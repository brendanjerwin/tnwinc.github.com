At Dev Labs, we pair together often. It's not a required situation as per the rules of [XP Pair Programming][] but it often happens naturally or when you just get sick of a problem and you need another set of eyes to look at it.

Of course, this means you have to sit close to your [coding buddy][] which usually means at least 2 things that make most developers uncomfortable:

1. You have to sit close to another human being.
1. You may have to smell someone else's breath.

I can't help you much with the first one, unless you want to have a pair of 37" TV's as your monitors so no one has to sit close to you. Wait, maybe that's not a bad idea....

The second one though we've attempted to solve by having a [communal pile of of Altoids][]. That's the 12 pack, feel free to buy less. And, it doesn't have to be Altoids of course, but I would have to question your sanity if you're having any other mints, Altoids are clearly superior :)

The convention is, before you go sit with someone, just grab a mint. Ideally, you won't have to be reminded, but we've also agreed that no one will be angry if they are reminded to visit the pile.

This reminds me, I just had some coffee...
